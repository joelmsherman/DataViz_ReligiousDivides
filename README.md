# Makeover Monday (MoM - Week 29
**The Dividing Light of Religion**

## MoM Background
Makeover Monday is a weekly learning and development opportunity to work with a given data set and create better, more effective visualizations.  The goal with MoM is to make information more accessible, and participants are from around the world.  MoM is sponsored by Tableau.  Each week, sponsors post a visualization to be improved, along with a dataset for the original visualization.  Participants then make and share their vizs and the community gets smarter and more creative as a whole!

## Week 29 Source Article and Viz
This week's Viz: Week 29 brings [an article](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/06/25/global-divide-on-homosexuality-persists/) about the global divide on homosexuality, in particular [a visualization](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w29-the-global-divide-on-homosexuality-persists) on how religion affects attitudes on the topic, by country.

## Week 29 Data Source
Data is from a 2019 Pew Research Center Study on global attitudes toward homosexuality.  A survey was conducted across 34 countries from May 13 to Oct. 2, 2019, totaling 38,426 respondents. The surveys were conducted using a mix of in-person interviews and telephone surveys.  More detail on the study methodology is available [here](https://www.pewresearch.org/methodology/international-survey-research/international-methodology/all-survey/all-country/all-year).

## My Approach for Week 29
The original viz is a simple table comparing statistically-significant proportions of people who say that homosexuality should be accepted by society across the two groups (1) respondents who said that religion was very important to them, and (2) respondents who said religion was NOT very important, including those who said it was somewhat, not too, or not at all important.  My approach is to show these basic statistics visually, using a simple diverging bar graph.
